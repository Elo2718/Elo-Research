            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="bio">
                <p>Hello! I'm Elhaam Bhuiyan, currently residing in Long Island City, NY. I am an enthusiastic Financial Mathematics student with strong technical skills and a passion for data science. My objective is to apply my analytical and problem-solving abilities to the real-world financial markets.</p>
                <p>I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Financial Mathematics at Baruch College, with a minor in Computer Science, and I expect to graduate in June 2026. I have maintained a GPA of 3.81, demonstrating my dedication and academic excellence. Relevant courses I have taken include Python Programming, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Calculus-Based Probability, Introduction to Pure Mathematics, Algorithms, Computers and Programming II (C++), Introduction to Machine Learning, and Numerical Methods for Differential Equations.</p>
                <p>My technical skills include programming languages such as C++, Python, HTML, as well as libraries and tools like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. I am proficient in design and IDE tools such as Visual Studio, Matlab, Spyder, and Jupyter Notebook, and I am experienced with MS Office tools, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I am also comfortable working with various operating systems, including OS X, Windows, and Linux.</p>
                <p>I have relevant experience as a Math Tutor at Baruch SEEK, where I assisted first-generation college students through SEEKâ€™s academic and financial support program, encouraging and motivating them to pursue mathematics-related majors.</p>
                <p>One of my notable academic projects involved developing an Implied Volatility Calculator, where I created an algorithm for numerical integration of a normal distribution using inputs such as option price, spot price, strike price, risk-free interest rate, and maturity time. I applied the Black-Scholes equation and Newton's method to determine implied volatility and planned future enhancements to integrate an option database for automated data collection.</p>
                <p>I am also involved in CUNY Tech Prep, a year-long technical and professional development program for CUNY computer science and related majors to learn in-demand technologies, master professional soft skills, and land great tech jobs in NYC.</p>
                <p>In my extracurricular activities, I serve as Secretary/Project Manager for the Financial Quants and Engineers club at Baruch College, and I practice kickboxing and Jiu-Jitsu at Tiger Schulmann's Martial Arts.</p>
                <p>I believe critical thinking and drive are essential traits for success. As an aspiring quantitative researcher, I aim to leverage mathematics, statistics, and computer science to uncover financial market opportunities. I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team, contributing to innovative financial solutions.</p>
